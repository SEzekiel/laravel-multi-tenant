Requirements & Assumptions:
- Linux/Unix server
- PHP 5.3+ (Laravel's minimum requirement) with Apache mod_rewrite enabled
- The main domain name is multisite.com
- All subdomain (http://*.multisite.com) are directed to the same IP. 
- Every tenants have their own database
- Every tenants have public directory at /tenants/{username}/public
- The rootsite (http://multisite.com, without subdomain) public directory (for serving static assets that can be accessed by any tenants) should be set to /public

1. Put `multisite` directory CONTENT into your document root (for example: /var/www/)

	example:
	www/
	 - application/
	 - bundles/
	 - laravel/
	 - public/
	 - tenants/
	 - paths.php
	 - DEPLOY
	 - ... etc

 2. We must have at least one MySQL user that has privilage to CREATE a new DATABASE (Say it USER A), and optionally an additional MySQL user (USER B) for tenants to use.

 3. Change these lines in /application/config/database.php according to USER A credential:

	'root' => array(
		'driver'   => 'mysql',
		'host'     => 'localhost',
		'database' => 'multisite',
		'username' => 'root',
		'password' => 'root',
		'charset'  => 'utf8',
		'prefix'   => '',
	),

4. Put the USER B credential to /bundles/tenancy/config/options.php (it can be same as USER A)

	return array(
		'db_prefix' => 'site_',
		'db_user'   => 'root',
		'db_pass'   => 'root',
	);

5. Set up the DB migration table. Open the command line shell, go to the root directory (/var/www) and type:

	php artisan migrate:install
	php artisan session:table
	php artisan migrate

	This step will create the required migration and session table then automatically generate 
	the `users` table on the database you choose before in step 3

6. Navigate to http://multisite.com/register for create a new user
